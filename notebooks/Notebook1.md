# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

One of the critiques I got is to give more specific examples of graphs that it would create. I figured I would do that because it is something important to sort out before I begin the project anyway. Also, this will really help with explaining more about the project and show why this would have an advantage over using an app. I also got feeback on my argument for the language due to privacy concerns. You could jast make an app that emphasizes privacy. I guess this shouldn't be used as a main argument for this language's creation. I just thought that would be another positive of the language even though it is the main goal I am working towards. Another thing I wasn't clear about was teh logging in the app itself. I will discuss this later in the journal. The feedback on what host language I should use was pretty helpful because it reinforced my own ideas. Overall, the feedback has really helped shape my plan of designing the language. 

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

One of my big decisions this week was choosing a host language. The three main languages I was considering were scala, R, and Python. I liked the idea for using R because it has a lot of built in things for data and data visualization that would save time, however I also liked the idea of using Python becuase it is a much simpler language than R and still does have good data visualization. The ease of use for the programmer is something really inportant to me, so I decided to not use R. I decided to use Scala as the host language because I have really enjoyed using it so far in this class and wanted to work with it more. I also found that it had lots of data visualization librariesan use to make my graphs. I found this website: https://analyticsindiamag.com/top-7-scala-libraries-for-data-visualisation/ that listed out a bunch of the top ibraries. I think I am going to use EvilPlot mainly because I just like the name. https://github.com/cibotech/evilplot It has teh capability to do line graphs which is all I need for this project. 

Now I want to talk about specific graphs that you would make with my language. All the graphs mainly be would be line graphs. You could use it to track change in weight over time and compare that to amount of calories eaten on each day or the amount of calories burned each day. You could also make a pie chart of the the percentage of each type of food eaten in a given period of time. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressuring issue was deciding how  was going to display the graphs. That one decision stemmed for a lot of other design questions like what host language to choose and what stats to track. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What other graphs would you want to make from this data? Would you find this langiage useful? 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

I have only spent a few hours outside of class this week, but I plan on mainly working on it tomorrow and tuesday.

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**

This week is going great. I have made most of my main decisions and just have to finalize some decisions on which data to track.
