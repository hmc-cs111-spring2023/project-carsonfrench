# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

One of the critiques I got is to give more specific examples of graphs that it would create. I figured I would do that because it is something important to sort out before I begin the project anyway. Also, this will really help with explaining more about the project and show why this would have an advantage over using an app. I also got feeback on my argument for the language due to privacy concerns. You could jast make an app that emphasizes privacy. I guess this shouldn't be used as a main argument for this language's creation. I just thought that would be another positive of the language even though it is the main goal I am working towards. Another thing I wasn't clear about was teh logging in the app itself. I will discuss this later in the journal. The feedback on what host language I should use was pretty helpful because it reinforced my own ideas. Overall, the feedback has really helped shape my plan of designing the language. 

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

One of my big decisions this week was choosing a host language. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
